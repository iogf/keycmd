1) Implement variants of the copy, move, delete etc
that work on the file/dir dir one level upwards.

2) Implement a statusbar where output of commands
could be shown.

3) It seems when a file name contains a '\n' character it can't
be accessed from the keycmd interface. It should be escaped as
a solution.
